The `<skin-styles>` component provides simple ways to use Material Design CSS styles
in your application. The following imports are available:

The following demos are available:
1. [buttons.html](https://github.com/FabricElements/skin-styles/blob/master/demo/buttons.html):
A complete set of custom buttons.
2. [grid.html](https://github.com/FabricElements/skin-styles/blob/master/demo/grid.html):
A grid layout using Bootstrap.
3. [typography.html](https://github.com/FabricElements/skin-styles/blob/master/demo/typography.html):
A Set of default styles for typography extending the paper default styles.

We recommend importing each of these individual files, and using the style mixins
available in each ones, rather than the aggregated `skin-styles.html` as a whole.
